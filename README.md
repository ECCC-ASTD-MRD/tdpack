TDPack library of thermodynamic functions

# At CMC

## Build dependencies

- CMake 3.20+

## Environment

Source the right file from the `ECCI_ENV` variable, depending on the desired
architecture.  This will load the specified compiler and set the
`EC_CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` variable for the `cmake_rpn` modules.

- Example for PPP5:

```
. $ECCI_ENV/latest/ppp5/inteloneapi-2022.1.2.sh
```

- Example for CMC network and gnu 11.4.0:

```
. $ECCI_ENV/latest/ubuntu-22.04-amd-64/gnu.sh
```

Since the default version of CMake available on ECCC systems is probably too
old, you need to load a version newer than 3.20.  For example: `. ssmuse-sh
-d main/opt/cmake/cmake-3.21.1`.

## Build and install

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make package
```

# Outside CMC (External users)

`cmake_rpn` is included as a git submodule.  Please clone with the
`--recursive` option or run `git submodule update --init --recursive` in the
git repo after having cloned.

## Build and install

```
mkdir build
